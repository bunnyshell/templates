                  We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re constantly
                  growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re constantly trying to
                  express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity to play
                  this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don&apos;t
                  appreciate the moment until it&apos;s passed.

                  It really matters and then like it really doesn&apos;t matter. What matters is the
                  people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it
                  doesn&apos;t matter. Because it&apos;s about motivating the doers. Because
                  I&apos;m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams,
                  too. We&apos;re not always in the position that we want to be at. We&apos;re
                  constantly growing. We&apos;re constantly making mistakes. We&apos;re constantly
                  trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity
                  to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people

                  The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun people
                  for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out. But the time is now
                  to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in what you believe in, if
                  you were the only one who believed it? If everything I did failed - which it
                  doesn&apos;t, it actually succeeds - just the fact that I&apos;m willing to fail
                  is an inspiration. People are so scared to lose that they don&apos;t even try.
                  Like, one thing people can&apos;t say is that I&apos;m not trying, and I&apos;m
                  not trying my hardest, and I&apos;m not trying to do the best way I know how.

                  I always felt like I could do anything. That&apos;s the main thing people are
                  controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They&apos;re slowed down
                  by their perception of themselves. If you&apos;re taught you can&apos;t do
                  anything, you won&apos;t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.

                  There&apos;s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn&apos;t able to get
                  good at. That&apos;s my skill. I&apos;m not really specifically talented at
                  anything except for the ability to learn. That&apos;s what I do. That&apos;s what
                  I&apos;m here for. Don&apos;t be afraid to be wrong because you can&apos;t learn
                  anything from a compliment. I always felt like I could do anything. That&apos;s
